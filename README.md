1) HTML -- Hyper Test Markup Language
2) standard markup language to create web pages
3) It describes the sructure of web pages
4) consist of series of elements
5) These elements tell browser how to display the content
6) These elements also label the pieces of content such as "this is a heading", this is a paragraph", etc

## Sample HTML Doc

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
    </head>
    <body>

    <h1>My First Heading</h1>
    <p>My first paragraph.</p>

    </body>
    </html>

    The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
    The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
    The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page
    The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
    The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
    The <h1> element defines a large heading
    The <p> element defines a paragraph

## HTML Elements

An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:

    <tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>

The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

    <h1>My First Heading</h1>
    <p>My first paragraph.</p>

    Note: Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!

So here you can basically svae the above sample HTML file as .html extention and then try to open that file using browser and you can see the content in the body tag displayed in the browser.
We have put the above sample doc file in "sample.html" file.

We have to start HTML Basics from above mentioned link.
